## Project Description
Meet with Wallet provides an easy way to share your (or your DAO's) calendar and schedule meetings without any hassle or back-and-forth communication. All possible by simply connecting your crypto wallet. No registration needed, no more emails (only if you want to) - Information about your meetings is encrypted and kept private (only you have access), and only meeting time slots are public for an improved user experience. You know Calendly right? Same thing here, but for #web3!

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
We use IPFS to store not only public information about wallet's calendars, but as well as private information about each meeting. The information is first encrpted with the user's wallet, and then upload to IPFS. Of course, it can only be decrypted by the same user (wallet).

## Project Status
MVP shipped, improving with new features and subscription plans for individuals, and strating the structure for DAOs/Communities.
